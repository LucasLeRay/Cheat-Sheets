# Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing services -- from applications to storage and processing power -- typically over the internet and on a pay-as-you-go basis.

## How cloud computing work

- Companies can rent access to anything from applications to storage from a cloud service provider.
- One benefit of using cloud computing services is that firms can avoid the upfront cost and complexity of owning and maintaining their own IT infrastructure
- Providers of cloud computing services can benefit from significant economies of scale by delivering the same services to a wide range of customers.

## Who is using cloud computing

- Organizations of every type, size, and industry are using the cloud for a wide variety of use cases, such as data backup, disaster recovery, email, virtual desktops, software development and testing, big data analytics, and customer-facing web applications.
- For example, healthcare companies are using the cloud to develop more personalized treatments for patients. Financial services companies are using the cloud to power real-time fraud detection and prevention. And video game makers are using the cloud to deliver online games to millions of players around the world.

## What available services

- Cloud computing services cover a vast range of options now, from the basics of storage, networking, and processing power through to natural language processing and artificial intelligence.
- Cloud computing can be broken down into three cloud computing models.

### Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)

It refers to the fundamental building blocks of computing that can be rented: physical or virtual servers, storage and networking.

### Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)

Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) is the next layer up that include the tools and software that developers need to build applications on top of: that could include middleware, database management, operating systems, and development tools.

### Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)

Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is the delivery of applications-as-a-service. The underlying hardware and operating system is irrelevant to the end user, who will access the service via a web browser or app; it is often bought on a per-seat or per-user basis.

## Cloud computing advantages

- Companies not having to buy or maintain their own computing infrastructure.
- Cloud services may be able to deliver a more secure and efficient service to end users.
- No more buying servers, updating applications or operating systems, or decommissioning and disposing of hardware or software when it is out of date, as it is all taken care of by the supplier.
- The ability to spin up new services without the time and effort associated with traditional IT procurement should mean that is easier to get going with new applications faster.

## Cloud computing disadvantages

- Cloud computing is not necessarily cheaper than other forms of computing, just as renting is not always cheaper than buying in the long term.
- Moving to a SaaS application may also mean you are using the same applications as a rival, which may make it hard to create any competitive advantage if that application is core to your business.
- Migrating existing data or apps to the cloud may be much more complicated and expensive.

## Types of cloud computing

1. **Public cloud** is the classic cloud computing model, where users can access a large pool of computing power over the internet.
2. **Private cloud** allows organizations to benefit from the some of the advantages of public cloud -- but without the concerns about relinquishing control over data and services, because it is tucked away behind the corporate firewall.
3. **Hybrid cloud** is perhaps where everyone is in reality: a bit of this, a bit of that. Some data in the public cloud, some projects in private cloud, multiple vendors and different levels of cloud usage.
